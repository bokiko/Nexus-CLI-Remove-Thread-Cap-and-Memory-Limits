> **Automatically remove artificial thread caps and memory limits from Nexus CLI to unlock your CPU's full potential.**

Nexus CLI artificially limits your CPU usage to 75% (or 8 threads max in older versions). This script removes those limits safely, allowing you to use **100% of your CPU cores** for maximum mining performance.

## 🎯 What This Does

### Before (Stock Nexus CLI)
```
CPU Cores: 32
Threads Used: 24 (75% limit) or 8 (hard cap)
RAM: Underutilized
Performance: Limited
```

### After (Unleashed)
```
CPU Cores: 32
Threads Used: 32 (or based on your RAM)
RAM: Fully utilized
Performance: Maximum
```

### Code Changes Made
1. **Removes 75% CPU Limit** - Changes `0.75` to `1.0` in CPU calculation
2. **Removes Thread Cap** - Changes `.clamp(1, 8)` to `.max(1)` 
3. **Disables Memory Checks** - Prevents automatic thread reduction

## 💻 System Requirements

| Component | Minimum | Recommended |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **OS** | Ubuntu 20.04+ / Debian | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS |
| **RAM** | 16 GB | 32 GB+ |
| **CPU** | 4+ cores | 16+ cores |
| **Storage** | 10 GB free | 20 GB+ free |
| **Network** | Stable internet | High-speed connection |

### RAM Guidelines
- **16 GB RAM** → Use up to 4 threads safely
- **32 GB RAM** → Use up to 8 threads safely  
- **64 GB RAM** → Use up to 16 threads safely
- **128 GB RAM** → Use up to 32 threads (full power!)

> **Note:** Each thread uses approximately **3-4 GB of RAM**

## 🎮 Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

**Start with maximum threads (all CPU cores):**
```bash
nexus-cli start --max-threads $(nproc)
```

**Start with specific thread count:**
```bash
nexus-cli start --max-threads 16
```

**Check your CPU core count:**
```bash
nproc
```

### Running in Background (Recommended)

**Using screen:**
```bash
# Start a new screen session
screen -S nexus

# Start Nexus CLI with your desired thread count
nexus-cli start --max-threads 16

# Detach from screen (keeps it running)
# Press: Ctrl+A, then D

# Reattach to screen later
screen -r nexus
```

**Using tmux:**
```bash
# Start tmux session
tmux new -s nexus

# Start Nexus CLI
nexus-cli start --max-threads 16

# Detach: Ctrl+B, then D
# Reattach: tmux attach -t nexus
```

### Monitoring Performance

**Check CPU usage:**
```bash
htop
```

**Check memory usage:**
```bash
free -h
```

**Monitor temperatures (if available):**
```bash
sensors
```

## 🔧 How It Works

### Technical Deep Dive

The script modifies the Nexus CLI source code to remove artificial limitations:

#### 1. CPU Limit Removal
```rust
// BEFORE: Only uses 75% of CPU cores
let max_workers = ((total_cores as f64 * 0.75).ceil() as usize).max(1);

// AFTER: Uses 100% of CPU cores
let max_workers = ((total_cores as f64 * 1.0).ceil() as usize).max(1);
```

#### 2. Thread Cap Removal
```rust
// BEFORE: Maximum 8 threads regardless of cores
let num_workers = max_threads.unwrap_or(1).clamp(1, 8) as usize;

// AFTER: Unlimited threads
let num_workers = max_threads.unwrap_or(1).max(1) as usize;
```

#### 3. Memory Check Bypass
```rust
// BEFORE: Automatically reduces threads on "low" memory
if max_threads.is_some() || check_mem {
    // memory checking code
}

// AFTER: Disabled (manual control)
if false {
    // never executes
}
```

### Version Detection Logic

The script automatically detects your Nexus CLI version by:

1. Checking for new structure: `clients/cli/src/session/setup.rs`
2. Checking for old structure: `src/session/setup.rs`
3. Searching entire codebase for thread-limiting code
4. Adapting modifications based on detected structure

## 🛡️ Safety & Backups

### Automatic Backups

The script creates **two types of backups** automatically:

#### 1. Source Code Backup
```
Location: ~/nexus-cli/[path]/setup.rs.backup.YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS
Example: ~/nexus-cli/clients/cli/src/session/setup.rs.backup.20250104_143022
```

#### 2. Binary Backup
```
Location: ~/.nexus/bin/nexus-cli.backup.YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS
Example: ~/.nexus/bin/nexus-cli.backup.20250104_143530
```

### Restoration Methods

#### Method 1: Restore from Binary Backup
```bash
# List available backups
ls -la ~/.nexus/bin/*.backup*

# Restore specific backup
cp ~/.nexus/bin/nexus-cli.backup.20250104_143530 ~/.nexus/bin/nexus-cli
```

#### Method 2: Fresh Installation
```bash
# Complete reinstall of official version
curl https://cli.nexus.xyz/ | sh
```

#### Method 3: Restore Source Code
```bash
# Find backup
ls -la ~/nexus-cli/**/setup.rs.backup*

# Restore and rebuild
cp ~/nexus-cli/clients/cli/src/session/setup.rs.backup.20250104_143022 \
   ~/nexus-cli/clients/cli/src/session/setup.rs

# Rebuild
cd ~/nexus-cli/clients/cli
cargo build --release
```

## 🔥 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### ❌ Problem: "Rust not found"
```bash
# Solution: Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

#### ❌ Problem: "Build failed"
```bash
# Solution 1: Update Rust
rustup update

# Solution 2: Clean build
cd ~/nexus-cli/clients/cli
cargo clean
cargo build --release

# Solution 3: Check logs
cat /tmp/nexus_build.log
```

#### ❌ Problem: "Out of memory" when running
```bash
# Solution: Reduce thread count
nexus-cli start --max-threads 4  # Start low
# Gradually increase: 4 → 8 → 16 → 32
```

#### ❌ Problem: "System freezing" during mining
```bash
# Solution: CPU is overheating or too many threads
# 1. Stop Nexus
pkill nexus-cli

# 2. Check temperature
sensors

# 3. Restart with fewer threads
nexus-cli start --max-threads 8
```

#### ❌ Problem: "Still seeing thread limit"
```bash
# Solution: Verify the modified binary is running
which nexus-cli  # Check location
nexus-cli --version  # Not all versions show this

# Rebuild if needed
bash nexus-unleash.sh
```

#### ❌ Problem: Script can't find setup.rs
```bash
# Solution: Manual search
cd ~/nexus-cli
find . -name "*.rs" -type f | xargs grep -l "num_workers"

# Then manually edit that file following the guide
```

## ❓ FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: Is this safe to use?**  
A: Yes! The script only modifies configuration values in the source code and creates backups before any changes. You can always restore the original version.

**Q: Will this get me banned from Nexus?**  
A: This script only removes artificial client-side limitations. It doesn't modify network protocols or exploit vulnerabilities. However, use at your own discretion.

**Q: Does this work on Windows?**  
A: No, this script is designed for Linux/Ubuntu. Nexus CLI itself runs on Linux servers.

**Q: How much performance improvement will I see?**  
A: Depends on your system:
- Systems with 8+ cores previously limited to 8 threads: **+100% to +300%**
- Systems limited to 75%: **+33%**
- Systems RAM-limited: Minimal (upgrade RAM first)

**Q: Do I need to rerun this script after Nexus updates?**  
A: Yes, if Nexus CLI updates, you'll need to rerun the script to apply optimizations to the new version.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What Nexus CLI versions does this support?**  
A: All known versions including:
- v0.10.17+ (new structure with 75% limit)
- v0.10.0-16 (old structure with 8-thread cap)
- Earlier versions (detected automatically)

**Q: Can I customize the modifications?**  
A: Yes! The script is open source. You can modify the sed commands to apply different values.

**Q: How do I verify the modifications worked?**  
A: Run `nexus-cli start --max-threads 32` (or your core count). If it starts with that many threads without error, it worked!

**Q: What if I want to use 150% of my CPU cores?**  
A: You can't exceed your physical core count. The script already allows 100% usage (all cores).
